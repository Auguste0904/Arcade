    Arcade is a gaming platform: a program that lets the user choose a game to play and keeps a register of player scores.
    You will be able to play 2 different video games (Nibbler or Pacman) and switch between them and graphic libraries when you want at running time.
    There are at least 3 different graphic libraries available: - SFML
